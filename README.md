# ok-coral
Make Coral comments OK again!

Adds basic z-key and "up" functionality

For mobile/tablets it also adds a 'Next Unread' button that appears on the right side.

## Usage

- Press 'z' to go to next comment and mark it as seen
- Press 'A' to mark all comments as seen
- Click the name of "in reply to [name]" to go to the original replied-to comment (this emulates the functionality of the "up" link)

## Installation 

- Install [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
or [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), or visit the [Tampermonkey website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for any other browser...

- Go to this [link](https://github.com/MikeSmithEU/ok-coral/raw/main/ok-coral.user.js), click "Install".

## Caveats

 - only works if current focus is in the comments (e.g. try to click an empty comment area first if it is not working)
 - only tested in FireFox and Chrome
