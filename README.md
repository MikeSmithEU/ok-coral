# ok-coral
Make Coral comments for OK again!

Adds basic z-key functionality (does not automatically load comments though)

## Installation 

- Install [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
or [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).

- Go to this [link](https://github.com/MikeSmithEU/ok-coral/raw/main/ok-coral.user.js), click "Install".

## Caveats

 - only works if current focus is in the comments (e.g. try to click an empty comment area first if it is not working)
 - does not automatically load new comments
 - possibly does not fully remove the styling of unread comments
 - only tested in FireFox
